# Random Color Generator
I change the background color of the page to a random color every time I click a button. I learned how to generate random HEXCODE values and utilize an addEventListener for everytime the button is clicked so an event (in this case a different color) can occur. I'm using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for everything else and Bootstrap 5.0.2 for the button outline look.
